we now can make API calls from the frontend using the url `localhost:8080/` + the url mapped to the method we want to use.
**Example:**
```javascript
const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/photos", {method: 'GET'})
```

This is how we make a get call.
## POST Call (CREATE)

To upload a new photo to our database we need to have a fileupload button and a submit button.

```javascript
return (
<div className={"upload"}>  
    <h4>Uploading</h4>  
    <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange}/>  
    <button onClick={uploadPhoto}>upload Photo</button>  
</div>
)
```

We also need a useState to read the change on the file input and an eventhandler wich onClick will read the latest `file` value

```javascript
//React needs a  useState and eventHandler for the upload input  
const [file, setFile] = useState(0);  
  
const handleFileChange = (event) => {  
    setFile(event.target.files[0]); // Capture the selected file  
};
```

Now we have the file we want to send to the backend. We make  POST call to the controller method mapped to `/photos`, with the `file` in the `formdata` body.

```javascript
 //Make a POST call with attached file from 'file' input  
const uploadPhoto = async () => {  
    if (!file) {  
        alert("Please select a file first!");  
        return;  
    }  
  
    const formData = new FormData();  
    // Use "data" as the field name to match the backend, append 'file' from input  
    formData.append("data", file);  
  
    try {  
        const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/photos", {  
            method: "POST",  
            body: formData,  
        });  
  
        // Read the response as JSON once  
        const responseBody = await response.json();  
  
        if (!response.ok) {  
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}\n${responseBody.message || "Unknown error"}`);  
        }  
  
        // Use the returned fileName for the alert  
        alert(`${responseBody.fileName} was uploaded successfully.`);  
    } catch (error) {  
        console.error("Error uploading photo:", error);  
        alert(`Error uploading photo: ${error.message}`);  
    }  
};
```

The controller will call the `PhotosService` to make the insert and return the Photo object created in the response. An alert is used to singal success or an error.

**Tipp: This is a subobtimal way uf doing this. A better way its to use return type  `ResponseEntity` in the controller**


## GET Call (READ)

What we want is a React component in the frontend wich has a button to call a `getAllPhotos` method which will make the API call and display the respone in a div.

```javascript
const TestPage = () => {  
    //we need this React hook to check if there are photos to be displayed  
    const [photos, setPhotos] = useState([])  
  
//make a get call and render the returned data in 'allphotos'  
	const getAllPhotos = async () => {  
	    const response = await fetch("http://localhost:8080/photos", {method: 'GET'})  
	    const data = await response.json()  
	    // this is just for debugging  
	    console.log(data);  
	    // puts the data into the photos state  
	    setPhotos(data);  
	};;  
    return (  
        <div className="testPage">  
            <h2>This Page is for testing the API calls</h2>  
            {/*//here we call the function*/}  
            <button onClick={getAllPhotos}>getPhotos</button>  
            {/*//here we render the photos*/}  
            <div className="photocontent">  
                {/*//here we map the photos [] to display div with every photo objects name and img*/}  
                {photos.map(photo =>  
                    <div key={"photo.id"}>  
                        <img src={"data:img/png;base64," + photo.data} alt=""/>  
						<h5>{photo.fileName}</h5>
                    </div>                )};  
            </div>  
        </div>    )  
};  
export default TestPage;

```

When `getAllPhotos` is called, the useStates setter is used to update `photos`. this will change the content of the `photocontent` div.

In our div `photocontent` we use the `map` function to create a component for every photo object that is returned. It is important to specify a key for the photo objects (in our case the id).

## DELETE Call (Delete)

The delete function was the hardest to implement. I had some help from @azu04 and @blu.

the function will delete an  Object by id so we need an input for id and a delete button

```javascript
<div>  
    <h4>Deleting</h4>  
    <input type="number" placeholder={"Id"} onChange={handleInputChange}/>  
    <button onClick={deletePhoto}>delete photo</button>  
</div>
```

Of course we also need the useState and eventhandler like we did with the `uploadPhoto` function.

```javascript
//useState for the 'Id' number input  
const [photoId, setPhotoId] = useState(0);  
  
//clickEventHandler for the delete button (read Id value)  
const handleInputChange = (event) => {  
    setPhotoId(event.target.value); // Update state on input change  
};
```

The delete function will check if `photoId` input is not empty. Then it will call the method mapped with `@DeleteMapping` in the `PhotosController`.

**Tipp: For delete to work, I had to add `@CrossOrigin` to the `Photoscontroller`**

```javascript
  //This is 'delete from photos where id = *' function
const deletePhoto = async () => {
    if (!photoId) {
        alert("Please enter a valid photo ID!");
        return;
    }
    try {
        const response = await fetch(`http://localhost:8080/photos/${photoId}`, {
            // header: {},
            method: "DELETE",
        });
        //for debugging
        // console.log(response)
        // Parse response as JSON
        const responseBody = await response.json();

        //if something goes wrong
        if (!response.ok) {
            // Use the error message from the backend
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}\n${responseBody.message || "Unknown error"}`);
        }
        //if delete is sucessfull
        alert(`${responseBody.fileName} was deleted successfully.`);
        console.log(responseBody); // Debugging
    } catch (error) {
        //if photo is not found this will fire
        console.error("Error deleting photo:", error);
        alert(`Error deleting photo: ${error.message}`);
    }
    //refresh Photo display after delete
    await getAllPhotos();
};
```

**Disclaimer**
I have to admit that I had a lot of help from @azu04 in rewriting the `delete` controller method. I do not fully understand every part of it but I will attepmpt to explain it.

This method will first use the `.get(id)` method to verify the photo exists. If it does it will save the name of the photo in a Hashmap. 
This basically does this:
`responseBody.filename = photo.getFileName()`

This way we don't have to return the whole photo object just to use the `fileName`.

On success we `put` the name of the photo into the response and return 
`ResponseEntity.ok` (wich equals status `200`)
If the Photo is not found, we `put` the message `"Photo not found"` into the response and return `NOT_FOUND` which equals 404.

````Java
 // this is the "delete from " method
@DeleteMapping("/photos/{id}")
public ResponseEntity<?> delete(@PathVariable Integer id) {
    // Check if the photo exists
    Photo photo = photosService.get(id); // Ensure this method retrieves the photo
    if (photo == null) {
        // Return a clear error response with 404 status
        Map<String, String> errorResponse = new HashMap<>();
        errorResponse.put("message", "Photo not found");
        return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(errorResponse);
    }
    Map<String, String> responseBody = new HashMap<>();
    responseBody.put("fileName", photo.getFileName());
    // Delete the photo
    photosService.delete(id);

    // Return the deleted photo with 200 OK status
    return ResponseEntity.ok( responseBody);
}
````
