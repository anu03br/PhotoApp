## Starting the webserver

In your project, there is a TestApplication. In our case, it is called `JdbcTestApplication` and it is located under:
`src/java/com.anu03.jdbcTest`

This is basically the Main class which contains the main method:

When we run the main method, IntelliJ will start a terminal which looks something like this:

The most important thing we can see here is that the Tomcat server was started on port 8080. If we open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/`, we will see a generic error message:

We are going to change this so we can display a custom message. This will basically be our very simple landing page for now.

Let's create a new Java class which will be a controller class:

We will use the `@RestController` annotation to tell Spring Web that this is a controller. IntelliJ should automatically add the necessary dependency:

If we restart our webserver by rerunning the main method, we should now see our custom message:
