## Project structure

since we want this project to have both a frontend and a backend, it seems like a good idea to redo the folder structure of our project for better navigation and clarity.

as you can see `.mvn` and `src` folder are located in a new `backend`  folder. I opened cmd in the project folder `jdbcTest` and ran `npx create-react-app frontend` to create a new folder `frontend` and initialize a react project in it.

I also moved the classes in `com.anu03.jdbcTest` into appropriate modules to make it tidier.

## Starting the frontend and backend

The backend can be started by running main in `JdbcTestApplication.java`. It will start the Tomcat router on port 8080.

the frontend can be started by opening an ide terminal and navigating to the `frontend` folder. then just run `npm start` and it will start the frontend on port 3000.
