## Project structure

since we want this project to have both a frontend and a backend, it seems like a good idea to redo the folder structure of our project for better navigation and clarity.

as you can see `.mvn` and `src` folder are located in a new `backend`  folder. I opened cmd in the project folder `jdbcTest` and ran `npx create-react-app frontend` to create a new folder `frontend` and initialize a react project in it.

I also moved the classes in `com.anu03.jdbcTest` into appropriate modules to make it tidier.

## Starting the frontend and backend

The backend can be started by running main in `JdbcTestApplication.java`. It will start the Tomcat router on port 8080.

the frontend can be started by opening an ide terminal and navigating to the `frontend` folder. then just run `npm start` and it will start the frontend on port 3000.

## Overriding CORS policy

Right now we can't execute any API calls from `localhost:3000` because the backend is running on another port. This violates the default CORS policy which is normally good for security reasons but in our case we don't need a secure Application - just a working one.

To override the CORS policy and allow the frontend to send requests to the backend we need to create a `webconfic.java` class to override the default `corsConfigurer` method.

Below is a very crude method to do this. We basically allow all types of API calls from all origins but again, because we only work on localhost this shouldn't matter.

**Never have a config like this for an actual deployed project**

```Java
package com.anu03.jdbcTest.config;  
  
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;  
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;  
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.CorsRegistry;  
import org.springframework.web.servlet.config.annotation.WebMvcConfigurer;  
  
@Configuration  
public class WebConfig {  
  
//    we need `@bean here or it wont work`  
    @Bean  
    public WebMvcConfigurer corsConfigurer() {  
        return new WebMvcConfigurer() {  
            @Override  
            public void addCorsMappings(CorsRegistry registry) {  
                registry.addMapping("/**").allowedOrigins("http://localhost:3000").allowedMethods("*").allowedHeaders("*");  
            }  
        };  
    }  
}
```
