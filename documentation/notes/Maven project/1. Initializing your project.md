## Spring initializr

Go to https://start.spring.io/

Choose:
- Maven
- Java
- Group = the group the project belongs to
- Artifact = project name
- Package = Jar
- Java version you have installed  
  You can get the Java version by opening cmd and running `java -version`

### Dependencies

If you add dependencies here, they will be added to your `pom.xml` and automatically loaded.

For this project, we go with:

#### Spring Web
It comes with a Tomcat webserver and allows you to create JSON for your API calls:

#### Spring Data JDBC
This is easier to manage than Spring Data JPA for beginners. It contains a lot of helper functions to build entities from your Spring classes:

Alternatively, you could use:

#### H2 Database
This is a simple in-memory database with the option to store the DB in a file like an SQLite Database:

You can now click the generate button, and it will download your project as a zip folder.

#### Open the project
Just unzip your project at the desired location and `open folder as IntelliJ project`.  
IntelliJ will automatically read your `pom.xml` and install all dependencies:

#### Project structure

Since there will be a frontend and a backend, I created a `backend` folder and moved the `.mvn` and `src` folders inside it. I also created a `data` folder for any database files.

Any frontend-related files would go into a `frontend` folder in the project folder.

### Troubleshooting
If you get a `Java version` error, make sure you have the correct Java version installed.  
Open cmd and type `java -version`. It should show you the version, which for this project must be 23. If it says `Java is not a recognized command`, then this means you have not added the `java/bin` to your PATH variables.  
If you have an older version, please get the new one from:  
https://www.oracle.com/ch-de/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk23-windows

Next, go to `File > Project Structure` in IntelliJ and make sure that Java 23 is selected as the project SDK:

If you still have errors, please paste your error message into ChatGPT or ask an adult for help.
